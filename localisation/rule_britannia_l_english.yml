The most important members of society therefore, are the landed gentry who own the fields and lease the land. The physiocrats reject the dominant economics of mercantilism in favour of an agrarian laissez faire approach; merchants of course do not generate wealth, but merely transport extraneous produce from place to place. While many find the depth of their economics impressive, others are more swayed by the tangible benefits of existing protectionist policies."

These fantastic collections include trophies from strange or mythical animals, artifacts from unknown cultures, rare minerals, and brightly-coloured shells from foreign shores. These cabinet exhibits are visited not only by curious aristocrats but also by naturalists interested in their scientific value.
