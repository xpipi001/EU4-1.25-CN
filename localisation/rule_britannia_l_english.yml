 industrialization_events.6.t: "Spinning Jenny"
 industrialization_events.6.d: "A major limitation for weaving productivity has long been the rate at which thread can be spun. Even before the introduction of the flying shuttle, one weaver required four spinners to service him. To overcome this hurdle [Root.inventor_name.GetName], an inventor from [invention_province.GetName], has devised a machine allowing one worker to do the work of many spinners.

 industrialization_events.17.d: "The changes in production methods that technological progress has brought have not been welcomed by everyone. Some feel that their livelihood is threatened by the growing mechanization and are causing trouble through protests and sabotage. In [luddite_province.GetName] things have even escalated into a full blown uprising among the artisans."

 anglican_events.1.t: "The Display of Royal Arms"
 anglican_events.1.d: "Following the destruction and removal of Papist symbols, Anglican churches were left somewhat bare of decoration. It has been decreed that in place of these blasphemous icons, the Royal Arms of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is to be displayed. The presence of the Royal Arms cements in the public consciousness the reality of the new order; that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is appointed by God not only as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Country], but also as Supreme Governor of the Church."
 anglican_events.1.a: "Display the Royal Arms proudly in every church."
 anglican_events.2.t: "Recusancy"
 anglican_events.2.d: "Attending Anglican services is mandatory in the [Root.GovernmentName] of $COUNTRY$. Recusancy is punishable by harsh fines. A person found guilty must forfeit all their goods and chattels, their lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and all of their rents and annuities. Enforcement, however, is difficult due to the sheer number of potential recusants, and so we should focus our efforts on the most concerning offenders.\n\nPopery is a particularly heinous crime. As the Pope denies the legitimacy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], so too must faithful Catholics, and thus all Catholics may be considered traitors to the state.\n\nRadical nonconformists such as the Puritans may also be targeted by these laws should they stray too far from the established doctrines of the Church.\n\nThe law enforces the uniformity of religious belief in $COUNTRY$, but it might also be used to discourage factionalism within the court. The mere suggestion of recusancy can destroy one’s reputation at court."
 anglican_events.2.a: "Target Catholics."
 anglican_events.2.b: "Target Puritans."
 anglican_events.2.c: "Target political threats."
 anglican_events.3.t: "Prophesying and Sermons"
 anglican_events.3.d: "The Anglican Church does not require that its clergy devote much time to preaching. A monthly or even quarterly sermon is adequate according to the law, which is usually lifted directly from the Book of Homilies.\n\nMany parishioners desire a more personal and involved approach to religious services, and have taken matters into their own hands by pooling money to pay for educated lecturers to preach in their towns. These lecturers however do not always have the most orthodox of theological views. It is often the case that the most eager to preach are those with the most radical ideas, and so these private sermons have become associated with the Puritan movement.\n\nWhile there are advantages to a more religiously literate populace, cracking down on Puritanism would increase the authority of the Church."
 anglican_events.3.a: "Ban these nonconformist sermons."
 anglican_events.3.b: "Let them preach as they wish."
 anglican_events.4.t: "Parliamentary Debate on Doctrine"
 anglican_events.4.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Parliament is often called upon to debate matters of religion. Typically, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will propose a new wave of reforms for the Anglican Church and the Parliament will take a stance along established factional lines; the Members in the Commons more likely to support radical or even Puritan measures, the Lords temporal more likely to favour a more conservative approach. Rarely does the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] get their way precisely, and when they do coercive measures are often involved."
 anglican_events.4.a: "Pass the reforms exactly as the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] proposed."
 anglican_events.4.b: "The Lords win the day."
 anglican_events.4.c: "The Commons have their way."
 anglican_events.5.t: "The Marprelate Tracts"
 anglican_events.5.d: "Dissatisfied with the conservative establishment of the Anglican Church, a group of Puritans writing under the pseudonym ‘Martin Marprelate? began publishing a series of scathing pamphlets directed at the Church leadership. The Bishops of $COUNTRY$, according to these writers, are ‘proud, popish, presumptuous, profane, paltry, pestilent and pernicious prelates? who usurp authority from God.\n\nThese tracts have garnered public attention and risk making a mockery of the Establishment lest something be done about them."
 anglican_events.5.a: "Ignore this nonsense."
 anglican_events.5.b: "Respond in kind, this is a war of pamphlets!"
 anglican_events.5.c: "Find and arrest the authors."
 anglican_events.6.t: "Prayer Book Rebellions"
 anglican_events.6.d: "The doctrines of the Anglican Church are contained within the Book of Common Prayer. It is a book that needs periodic revisions to accord with changes in Anglican thought, as it shifts between more radical and more traditional theology. The most recent edition contains material that has greatly angered the people of [prayer_book_province.GetName], many of whom still cling to Catholic dogmas and practices. They have risen up in revolt, demanding that the Book be reverted to its previous edition."
 anglican_events.6.a: "Repeal the new edition and make traditionalist concessions."
 anglican_events.6.b: "We will not tolerate papist treason!"
 anglican_events.7.t: "Crypto-Catholic Statesman"
 anglican_events.7.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Reformation did not sway the hearts and minds of the entire population. Many continue to harbour Catholic sympathies, even among the court. It has been discovered that $STATESMAN$ has been secretly attending a Catholic Mass, a practice strictly forbidden by law. If exposed they stand to lose all of their land and property, and will no longer be eligible for public office."
 anglican_events.7.a: "They're too useful, for now."
 anglican_events.7.b: "No Catholics in my court!"
 anglican_events.7.c: "Off with his head!"
 anglican_events.8.t: "Prayers to Saints"
 anglican_events.8.d: "When $COUNTRY$ broke with Rome, we did away with the superstitious notion that prayers should be directed to the Saints rather than to God himself. As our new theology has no place for the papist concept of Purgatory, there is no need for Saints to intercede on behalf of our souls. Despite this, many people continue the practice of praying to Saints, and many churches give excessive reverence to their patron."
 anglican_events.8.a: "It's harmless, we can allow this."
 anglican_events.8.b: "Uniformity must be enforced"
 anglican_events.9.t: "Abolition of Feast Days"
 anglican_events.9.d: "The Catholic liturgical calendar is filled with feast days that function as public holidays and occasions for celebration. No longer under Papal authority, our own Church must decide how far this practice ought to continue. Those most fervent reformers argue that superfluous holidays encourage sinful temptation and distract from gainful labour. This has been met with broad agreement in terms of theology, but abolishing feast days is likely to upset the populace who do so enjoy the occasional day off."
 anglican_events.9.a: "Abolish more feast days."
 anglican_events.9.b: "Let them have their fun."
 anglican_events.10.t: "Puritans Leaving for the Colonies"
 anglican_events.10.d: "The Puritans have for some time criticized the hierarchy and doctrines of the Church of $COUNTRY$. The Reformation has to their eyes merely replaced the Pope with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and they openly denounce the state’s slothful attitude to reform. Theological disputes aside, Puritans have also been persecuted as nonconformists, depending on the leanings of the current [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Finally exhausted by the religious affairs of Europe, many Puritans have decided to migrate in the New World. They have organised themselves into a colonial company an requested a charter to establish new settlements in the Americas."
 anglican_events.10.b: "Integrate them into an established colony."
 anglican_events.10.a: "Let them build their own settlement."
 anglican_events.11.t: "Controversy over Vestments"
 anglican_events.11.d: "The matter of clerical vestments remains a contentious issue in the Anglican Church. The extravagant and superstitious rags of the papists are surely to be done away with, but the degree of austerity required of the clergy continues to inflame debate and protest.\n\nConservative Anglicans wish to reinstate some of the elaborate trappings of the old Catholic priesthood, while moderates argue that a simple surplice is sufficient. Radical reformers insist that vestments are not merely lacking scriptural support, but deface and corrupt the ordinances which God has instituted."
 anglican_events.11.a: "Allow traditional vestments."
 anglican_events.11.b: "Surplices only."
 anglican_events.11.c: "Denounce all vestments."
 anglican_events.12.t: "Smashing Altars"
 anglican_events.12.d: "The early years of the English Reformation are a time of fervent iconoclasm. Any adornment or relic that even suggests Papism, the existence of Purgatory, or the divinity of saints is being ruthlessly stripped from the churches. Anything that could lead the laity astray must be destroyed; altars are smashed, paintings painted over, shrines ruined.\n\nA perpetual issue for the new Anglican Church is the matter of how far this iconoclasm should be taken. Some more radical reformers push for an end to roods, candlesticks, and crucifixes, while others seek the restoration of some of the more harmless ornaments."
 anglican_events.12.a: "Smash the altars and imprison papist protesters!"
 anglican_events.12.b: "Destroy only what is undeniably papist."
 anglican_events.12.c: "Put an end to this iconoclasm."
 anglican_events.13.t: "Catholic Instigators"
 anglican_events.13.d: "Though $COUNTRY$ has formally split from the Rome, the Pope continues to meddle in our affairs by orchestrating plots against [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Jesuits and priests number among his agents, sheltered by traitorous recusants.\n\nThese crypto-Catholics employ cunning methods of hiding Papist agents from the law, deviously building secret areas behind walls, under the floorboards, and even in concealed underground passageways. Hiding in these 'priest holes' can injure or even suffocate their occupants, so they are at least unlikely to be able to make a quick escape once located."
 anglican_events.13.a: "Conduct a national priest-hunt. Search every house!"
 anglican_events.13.b: "Find out where they're coming from"
 anglican_events.14.t: "The Church of $COUNTRY$"
 anglican_events.14.d: "As the Protestant Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favouring the Protestant cause and others defending the traditional religion.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Reformed, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.\n\nSuch a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God."
 anglican_events.14.a: "Found a new state Church"

While many of them are just popular ballads, stories or gossip, some are thinly veiled attempts at criticizing the pillars of our state, and the religious establishment.\nThe spread of a particularly immoral and political ballad has led to demands that we limit the press more harshly and that we take disloyal printers and their products into our care."

 innovativeness_events.2.d: "As a member of the cabinet [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has had good opportunity to expand on [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] personal interests. As a result [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] manor outside [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] boasts one of the largest laboratories in the country, with many furnaces, and large stores of all kinds of materials imaginable.  [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] is also particularly proud of what [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] calls [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ‘chamber of wonders?, a large office filled with curiosities from roof to floor, as well as a library dedicated to explaining the objects. Such habits do not come cheap however and as our dear minister asks for a place to study the moon and the stars as well, a tailor made castle observatory, some feel that perhaps this should be the limit of our generosity."

The physicians claim this allows them to improve their knowledge of the human body, documenting it for the betterment of mankind. Improving the grasp of human anatomy is not an argument that impresses locals when the graves of recently deceased are found open in the morning however. The citizens of [doctor_province.GetCapitalName] are now demanding that we restrict these horrible practices and that we put a stop to the grave robbers."

[Root.inventor.GetName] has been described by some as one of the great minds of this age, producing many mechanical and chemical inventions beyond the understanding of most others."

Some have begun to form regular discussion groups while others use letters to correspond with other inquisitive minds.\nOne such group has contacted our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], asking for patronage and support.

They are asking for funding to open a new college where they can further develop what they call ‘new science?, with a more experimental outlook and what they claim to be a less dogmatic approach to the world.\nOf course within the existing academy there is some resistance to these would-be reformers. They argue that the money could be better spent supporting the existing institution as new ideas are not necessarily better ideas."
 innovativeness_events.7.a: "Enlarge the University? Sounds like a good idea."
 innovativeness_events.7.b: "Let us listen to the conservatives."
 innovativeness_events.8.t: "Dissenting Academies"
 innovativeness_events.8.d: "Institutions of higher learning typically restrict enrollment to adherents of the dominant faith. This forces nonconforming prospective students to seek their education outside of state-sanctioned universities. Thankfully for them, a number of informal academies have been founded in $COUNTRY$ that cater to religious dissidents of various sorts, often promoting a particular theological position. Such academies may strictly be at odds with the law, as schools generally require the assent of local or national religious authorities, but they provide education to students who would otherwise be barred from admission."
 innovativeness_events.8.a: "Let them teach as they please."
 innovativeness_events.8.b: "Religious uniformity must be enforced."
 innovativeness_events.9.t: "Treatise on Natural Philosophy"
 innovativeness_events.9.d: "A promising thinker to some, a dangerous instigator to others, [Root.scientist.GetName] has recently published a new work of natural philosophy, showing that it is very likely that many of the things we have held evident up until now might in fact be wrong. To make matters worse the thinker has also used the opportunity provided by the publication to mock the religious establishment. Taken together this has created a strong aversion against these new ideas, with some arguing that [Root.scientist.GetName] should be incarcerated and punished, while others at the very least distance themselves from the text."
 innovativeness_events.9.a: "These are interesting ideas..."
 innovativeness_events.9.b: "We cannot allow such blasphemy!"
 innovativeness_events.10.t: "Unpopular Mathematician"
 innovativeness_events.10.d: "Like many rulers of this age [Root.Monarch.GetName] has wanted to surround [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with great minds that can debate the secrets of the world. Some poses great wit and excell at debates, while others are more suited for solitary experiments or mathematical calculations. There is no doubt quite a bit of rivalry at times, as the favor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] can be a very beneficial thing to have for any thinker, scientist or inventor.\nOne such intelligent fool has lately come to be ridiculed by many peers. [Root.mathematician.GetName] has a great mind for mathematics but is a notably poor debater, and some would argue the reputation of the court suffers for indulging such work."
 innovativeness_events.10.a: "Let them talk."
 innovativeness_events.10.b: "He is embarrassing us."
 innovativeness_events.11.t: "Terra Australis"
 innovativeness_events.11.d: "Scholars as ancient as Aristotle have theorized that there must exist a great unknown continent in the extreme south of the world. Now that traversing the globe has become dramatically more accessible, explorers, cartographers, and scientists are beginning to take an interest in the missing continent once again. They speculate that some of the islands thus far discovered in the region may be the terminus of large archipelagos. An expedition to the far south would be expensive, take a great deal of preparation, and test the limits of our seafaring technology."
 innovativeness_events.11.a: "Fund a research and exploratory expedition."
 innovativeness_events.11.b: "This is a waste of time and resources."
 innovativeness_events.12.t: "Coffee Houses"
 innovativeness_events.12.d: "The introduction of coffee to $COUNTRY$ has hit the nation by storm, with coffee houses springing up in cities throughout the land. Miniscule admission fees ensure that the educated and uneducated, rich and poor alike can go to a coffee house and join the lively debates within. Popular topics of discussion include philosophy, politics, gossip, and finance. A natural meeting place for intellectuals, the coffee house is becoming synonymous with debate and learning."
 innovativeness_events.12.a: "Encourage these gatherings."
 innovativeness_events.12.b: "Dangerous ideas are spreading."
 innovativeness_events.13.t: "Scientific Instruments"
 innovativeness_events.13.d: "With new developments in the art of glassmaking and metalwork comes the ability to create more refined scientific instruments. Lenses that magnify the very distant and the very small are invaluable to our astronomers and natural philosophers, while chemists hone their craft with more complex metal tools. Recent breakthroughs have given $COUNTRY$ a scientific edge in the production of this equipment. We can but eagerly await the discoveries that have been made possible."
 innovativeness_events.13.a: "Can they turn lead into gold yet?"
 innovativeness_events.14.t: "Physiocrats"
 innovativeness_events.14.d: "A new flavour of economics, known as physiocracy, is becoming popular among the [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments]. Physiocrats hold that the basis of wealth is agricultural production, by which all of civilization is made possible. The most important members of society therefore, are the landed gentry who own the fields and lease the land. The physiocrats reject the dominant economics of mercantilism in favour of an agrarian laissez faire approach; merchants of course do not generate wealth, but merely transport extraneous produce from place to place. While many find the depth of their economics impressive, others are more swayed by the tangible benefits of existing protectionist policies."
 innovativeness_events.14.a: "Perhaps this is worth a try."
 innovativeness_events.14.b: "Landowners have too many privileges already."
 innovativeness_events.15.t: "Cabinet of Curiosities"
 innovativeness_events.15.d: "The exploration of new lands and the opening of trade with distant nations has brought all manner of curious objects to our shores. It has become fashionable to gather collections of these often bizarre items and display them alongside more mundane treasures such as portraits and religious icons. These fantastic collections include trophies from strange or mythical animals, artifacts from unknown cultures, rare minerals, and brightly-coloured shells from foreign shores. These cabinet exhibits are visited not only by curious aristocrats but also by naturalists interested in their scientific value. Of course it sometimes turns out that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s prized unicorn horn is simply the tusk of a narwhal."
 innovativeness_events.15.a: "How very novel. Commission one immediately."
 innovativeness_events.15.b: "This is silly. We should patronise religious institutions instead."
